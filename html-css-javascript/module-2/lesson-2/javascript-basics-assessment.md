# JavaScript Basics Assessment

Before continuing with the lessons go ahead and attempt the following assessment. These will be a good way to test your understanding of the knowledge you just gained.

### **Instructions:** 

* Create a new folder in your **prework repo** called `JavaScript_Basics_Assessment`.
* Complete the following activities in separate files named after each activity, `activity-2.js`, etc.
* When you have completed the activities push the files to your GitHub Repo.

**Activity 1: Flowcharting:**

Using a flowcharting tool of your choice, create a flowchart for a program that:

1. Contains a list.
2. Expects a user input and stores it in a variable.
3. After the user inputs data and clicks a submit button, that data gets stored in the list.
4. After the data gets stored in the list, render that list.

**Activity 2: JavaScript Math Quiz:**

Using JavaScript, compute the following:

1. The product of 9 and 9
2. The quotient of 56 and 12
3. The remainder of 281 divided by 9
4. 18 divided by 0
5. The sum of string 56 and string 92
6. Using any comparison operator you wish on the numbers 42 and 52, make it evaluate to `false`.

**Activity 3: JavaScript Variables, Alerts, Prompts, and Conditionals:**

1. Grab a user input using a `prompt()` and store it in a variable.
2. Add a conditional statement where if the variable's length is greater than `4`, we alert the user that their name is greater than four characters.
3. Otherwise, alert that their name is less than four characters.

**Activity 4: JavaScript Arrays and Loops:**

1. Start off by creating an array with three student names.
2. Create a loop that will prompt the user for three more names.
3. After every user input, store the new name into the array.
4. Create a new loop that will iterate through the array and console log each element of the array.
