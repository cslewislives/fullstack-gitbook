# Flowchart Conditionals

### What, Why, and When

Conditionals control behavior in JavaScript and determines whether or not pieces of code will or will not run. 

Using conditionals in your websites and webapps will make it far more dynamic.

Let's say you want to check if someone is taller than 4'8". If they are taller than 4'8", then you will allow them on the roller coaster. If they are not, you'll have to regretfully turn them away. That's a conditional! What if you only want to display a discount at checkout _if_ the user provided a valid discount code? That's another conditional!

### Flowchart Conditionals

Loops and listeners allow us to control the flow of our program. 

So far we've learned two control flow statements - loops and event listeners. 

* Loops allow us to perform the same operation\(s\) over and over simultaneously. 
* Listeners allow us to define operations that will only run once an event \(like a button click\) takes place.

Both of these tools allow us to control the order in which operations take place.

There's one more control flow operation that we need to cover - **conditionals**. 

Conditionals allow us to run a certain set of operations only if a certain condition is met. Imagine again that we are building a login page. We only want to grant users access _if_ their username and password match a username/password pair in our database. This requires a conditional.

Any time you are talking through a programming problem and you say _if_ you probably need a conditional.

Conditionals often involve a comparative operator like `>`, `<`, or `===`.

This is how we represent a conditional in a flowchart.

If `num` equals `10`, we display "best number", otherwise we display "other number".

**Remember** that `=` is the assignment operator in JavaScript and _assigns_ a value to the variable on the left. `===` is the equality comparator and checks to see if two values are equal.
