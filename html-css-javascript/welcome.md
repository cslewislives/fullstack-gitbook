# Welcome

The following modules exist to assess your learning capabilities in a short amount of team. You will have **2 weeks** to complete these modules in order to be given a slot in the class.

These are your deliverables for this work:

* **Two Module Assessments**
  * Each module has an Assessment at the end.
  * These are larger projects and will be a good representation of how much you have learned from these modules
* **Lesson Assessments**
  * Any time you come across a page titled Assessment these will be required activities to be eligible for completion of this course
  * These are smaller activities or drills that will serve as a quick assessment of your skills and understanding of the lessons

Through out the lessons you will come across pages with **Activity** in the title. These are not required for completion **however,** we highly suggest you attempt them as practicing what you've learned is the best way to achieve mastery.
