* **Letter Spacing**
  * Spacing between individual letters—try to avoid cramping
* **Sans-Serif vs Serif**
  * Sans-serif are fonts sans their serifs—no tails. They’re easier to read online

### Typography Activity

Using the following [**JSBin** link](https://jsbin.com/fahexeb/2/edit?html,css,output) create the CSS to modify the typography of each of the body paragraphs.

Be sure to modify the following CSS properties for each paragraph of your page:

* font-family
* font-size
* font-weight
* line-height

**Hint!:** You will need to do two things to accomplish this task:

* Create classes for each paragraph
* Add in styles for each class
