For reference, the colors used on the screen are `#eee` and `#999`.

For further reference, you can generate paragraphs of lorem ipsum text using [http://www.lipsum.com/feed/html](http://www.lipsum.com/feed/html). You need to make this page scroll to see how the fixed position element behaves.

Use the code from the last few activities to help get you started.
