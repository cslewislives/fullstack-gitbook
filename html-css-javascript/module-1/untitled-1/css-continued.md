# CSS Combinators

### Combinators

In the previous lesson, we used two types of selectors - elements \(like `h1` and `body`\) and classes \(like `.dark` and `.big`\). 

Sometimes we want to be more specific than this. Maybe we want to make every paragraph that's in a `div` blue, but _only_ paragraphs inside `div`s, not all paragraphs.

We can do this by including a combinator in between selectors to target a more specific subset of elements.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

* Descendant Selector
* Child Selector
* Adjacent Sibling Selector
* General Sibling Selector

#### **Descendant selector \( space \)**

Descendant selectors selects elements that are descendants of the specified elements

```css
div p {
  background: teal;
}
/* this will make the background of all p tags that are descendants of div tags teal */
```

#### **Child selector \( &gt; \)**

Child selectors select elements that are IMMEDIATE children of the specified element

```css
div > p {
  background: teal;
}
/* this makes the background of all p tags that are immediate children of a div tag teal */
```

Child selectors and descendant selectors are similar, but not quite the same. A good analogy here would be that my daughter is my child and my descendant. My granddaughter is not my child, but she is my descendant

#### **Adjacent sibling selector \( + \)**

Adjacent sibling selectors selects elements that are placed immediately after the specified element

```css
div + p {
  background: teal;
}
/* this makes the background of all p tags that are immediately after a div tag teal */
```

#### **General sibling selector \( ~ \)**

General sibling selectors selects ALL elements that are siblings of a specified element

```css
div ~ p {
  background: teal;
}
/* this makes the background of all p tags that are the same level as a div tag teal */
```

#### **Grouping \( , \)**

You can write groups of selectors separated by commas to apply the same rule to multiple elements

```css
h1, section {
  background: teal;
}
/* this makes the background of all h1 tags AND section tags teal */
```

#### Chaining Combinators

Multiple combinators can be chained together as well

```css
h1 > div > p {
  style properties for the child p tag of the child div tag of the h1 tag
}
```

/* ---Descendent Selector--- */
/* div p {
    color: red;
} */


/* ---Child Selector--- */
/* div > p {
    color: red;
} */


/* ---Adjacent Selector--- */
/* div + p {
    background-color: yellow;
} */


/* ---General Sibling Selector--- */
/* div ~ p {
    background-color: yellow;
} */
```
