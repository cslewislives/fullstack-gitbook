**Instructions:**

Take a website that you commonly use \(Amazon, Huffington Post, etc.\) and heavily modify it using the Chrome Developer Tools. Really get creative here!

Be sure to at least modify:

* Content \(Change words\)
* Colors \(Background\)
* Spacing \(Between any elements of your choosing\)
* Images

Take a screen print of your changes!

**Challenge:**

Modify the font color, weight, and size of the text on the website.

To any image on the site, add a box shadow. \(**Hint**: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)\)
