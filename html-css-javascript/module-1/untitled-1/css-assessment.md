Goals:

* Create a new folder in your **prework repo** titled `CSS_Assessment`
* Create a new application \(`index.html` and `style.css`\) in the new folder and ensure that you link properly.
* Create a navigation bar \(a box that spans the width of the browser and sits only at the top of the page\).
* Create another two boxes below the navigation bar. The first box should take up 1/2 of the width of the browser. Add the text, "Left" inside of this box and ensure that the text is aligned in the center horizontally and vertically.
* The second box should take up 1/4th of the width of the browser and align right. Add the text, "Right" inside of this box and ensure that the text is aligned in the center horizontally and vertically.
* Create a footer bar \(a box that spans the width of the browser and sits at the bottom of the page\).
