# Divs and HTML Attributes

Now that you know basic HTML, we'll be taking a more granular look at HTML.

We'll be checking out two very useful concepts in HTML: **Divisions and HTML attributes.**

### **Divs**

A **div** is short for division and is used to help create sections within our HTML. 

Divs aren't visible unless we add styling to it but you can think of divs as a way to separate and contain HTML code. 

```markup
<div> 
    <h1>This header tag is contained within a div!</h1> 
</div>
```

The above code is also called, "**nesting**", because we can "nest" code within other code! This is usually done by indenting.

### HTML Attributes

HTML Attributes are a way for our HTML elements to have additional information. 

Remember image tags? We had to pass in additional data about the source and alternate description.

```markup
<img src='image.jpg' alt='example-image'>
```

In the above example, "**src**" and "**alt**" are HTML attributes of the image HTML tag.
