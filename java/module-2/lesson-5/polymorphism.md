# Polymorphism

 Because inheritance represents an **is-a** relationship, there is the possibility of treating a derived class like its parents. This is the main concept of polymorphism.

* With the animal -&gt; mammal -&gt; dog hierarchy
  * Can we treat a dog as a mammal?
  * What happens if we do?
  * Can we "access" all the features of a dog if we're treating it as a mammal?
* With our class hierarchy: Developer -&gt; TeamLead -&gt; Architect.
  * What happens if we treat an Architect as a TeamLead?
  * Can we use all the characteristics of an Architect if we treat it as a TeamLead?
* What about treating an Architect as a Developer?
  * What happens if we do that?
  * Can we use all the characteristics of an Architect?
  * Can we use all the characteristics of a TeamLead?

**Definition**

"Polymorphism means 'many formed.' As demonstrated above, objects in an inheritance hierarchy can take many forms."
