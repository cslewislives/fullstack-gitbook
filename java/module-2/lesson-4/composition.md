# Composition

Composition is another tool to help us organize and write code that solves more complex problems.

Composition allows us to express a has-a relationship. We will explore what that relationship is and how composition allows us to express it in Java code.

Composition is a technique that allows us to reuse existing code and reduce the amount of code we need to write. We do not want to reinvent the wheel if we don't have to!

#### Key Points of Composition

* One of the key features of an object-oriented language is that objects can be made up of other objects. We call this composition.
* There is no reason to reinvent the wheel if there is existing code we can leverage.
* Oftentimes, it is useful to pull code out into new classes so the code can be used in several places.
* We keep the details of what we're implementing and what we're delegating as part of our **private implementation**; the outside world doesn't need to know how we implement the features of our class.
* Composition represents what we call a **has-a** relationship.

#### Real World Examples of Composition

* A house **has-a** refrigerator.
* A car **has-an** engine.
* A bedroom **has-a** bed.
