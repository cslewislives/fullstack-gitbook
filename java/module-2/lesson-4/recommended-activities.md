## Activities

There are two files associated with the Lesson 4 activities.  

1. The first set of katas involves creating a UML diagram for a Home and the various rooms. Upon completion of the diagram, create an IntelliJ project that mirrors the Home and the rooms of which it is 'comprised'.
2. Utilize the starter code included with the second activity to navigate through the creation and extension of vehicle interface and various related classes. 

You **should** write your code to **pass the tests** that are included with the starter file. The tests will be triggered when the IntelliJ program is run. The output screen will detail any discrepancies.  

As always, we do encourage you to search Google for information on challenging concepts.

Solutions for these activities can be found in the Java Activities-Solution Files section of this Gitbook.
