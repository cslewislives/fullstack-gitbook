# When to Use Composition

The following is an example of a less-than-optimal class. This example represents an e-commerce site that uses separate home and shipping address components. 

* This model is cumbersome at best.
  * We have some repetition that can be DRYed up, and we can use composition to implement a solution.

```java
package com.company.composition;

public class BadAccount {

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private String username;

    private String homeStreet;
    private String homeCity;
    private String homeState;
    private String homeZipcode;

    private String shippingStreet;
    private String shippingCity;
    private String shippingState;
    private String shippingZipcode;

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public void setUsername(String username) {
        this.username = username;
    }

    public String getHomeStreet() {
        return homeStreet;
    }

    public void setHomeStreet(String homeStreet) {
        this.homeStreet = homeStreet;
    }

    public String getHomeCity() {
        return homeCity;
    }

    public void setHomeCity(String homeCity) {
        this.homeCity = homeCity;
    }

    public String getHomeState() {
        return homeState;
    }

    public void setHomeState(String homeState) {
        this.homeState = homeState;
    }

    public String getHomeZipcode() {
        return homeZipcode;
    }

    public void setHomeZipcode(String homeZipcode) {
        this.homeZipcode = homeZipcode;
    }

    public String getShippingStreet() {
        return shippingStreet;
    }

    public void setShippingStreet(String shippingStreet) {
        this.shippingStreet = shippingStreet;
    }

    public String getShippingCity() {
        return shippingCity;
    }

    public void setShippingCity(String shippingCity) {
        this.shippingCity = shippingCity;
    }

    public String getShippingState() {
        return shippingState;
    }

    public void setShippingState(String shippingState) {
        this.shippingState = shippingState;
    }

    public String getShippingZipcode() {
        return shippingZipcode;
    }

    public void setShippingZipcode(String shippingZipcode) {
        this.shippingZipcode = shippingZipcode;
    }
}
```
