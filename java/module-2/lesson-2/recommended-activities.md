## Activities

There are two files associated with the Lesson 2 activities. 

1. The first kata involves building classes based off of the UML diagrams provided along with the starter code. 
2. The second kata has you create methods associated with each of the objects created in the first activity. 

Specific instructions are included with each of the activities. 

You **should** write your code to **pass the tests** that are included with the starter file. The tests will be triggered when the IntelliJ program is run. The output screen will detail any discrepancies.  

As always, we do encourage you to search Google for information on challenging concepts.

Solutions for these activities can be found in the Java Activities-Solution Files section of this Gitbook.
