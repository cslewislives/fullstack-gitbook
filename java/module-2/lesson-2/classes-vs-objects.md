# Classes vs Objects

Let's take a step back to understand what exactly we are doing here.

There are several key practical components to object-oriented programming \(OOP\) in Java - classes, objects, abstract classes, interfaces, and the hierarchical relationships between these are the focus of this unit.  

For this lesson, we're going to focus on the first two: classes and objects. Classes are like a blueprint from which objects are created. In a class, you define methods and properties \(variables\). Each object created from a class gets a copy of these methods and properties. 

Going back to the blueprint analogy, imagine you were the head of a real-estate development firm. You just bought a large swath of land and you want to build an affordable mixed-development neighborhood. So you make a blueprint for single-family homes, another for multi-family homes, a third for 2-story shops, and a final blueprint for 4-story buildings with shops on the bottom floor and apartments on the top three floors. 

You only have four blueprints. From these four blueprints, you can quickly build an entire neighborhood.

Classes are like blueprints in that they allow you to create many similar objects quickly and easily. Just like a real-estate developer can quickly build a neighborhood from four blueprints, a developer can quickly build a sizable application using only a few classes as the model for all the objects they will need.

If this all feels very abstract right now, don't worry! It'll make a lot more sense after the next few lessons.
