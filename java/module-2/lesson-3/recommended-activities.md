## Activities

Utilizing the starter code, create the classes and interfaces specified in the provided instructions.

You **should** write your code to **pass the tests** that are included with the starter file. The tests will be triggered when the IntelliJ program is run. The output screen will detail any discrepancies.   

As always, we do encourage you to search Google for information on challenging concepts.
