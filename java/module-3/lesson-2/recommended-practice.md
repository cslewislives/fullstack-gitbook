## Activities

The following activities will enhance your understanding of Iterators and Lists. Details for each of the activities can be found inside the file. 

* Refactor array the provided array methods using ArrayList.
* Refactor the methods using a LinkedList.
* Create a List for your future 'Classmates' . 
* Create a class the incorporates Iterators and HashSets.

You **should** write your code to **pass the tests** that are included with the starter file. The tests will be triggered when the IntelliJ program is run. The output screen will detail any discrepancies.  

As always, we do encourage you to search Google for information on challenging concepts.

Solutions for these activities can be found in the Java Activities-Solution Files section of this Gitbook.
