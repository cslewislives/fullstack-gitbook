# Stream Processing vs. Iterators and Loops

#### Loops Iterators vs. Streams and Aggregate Operations

Processing objects in a collection using loops/iterators and processing them using streams and aggregate operations have a lot in common, but there are some key differences:

* Loops/iterators work directly on objects from the collection, but aggregate operations work on objects from a stream.
* The developer must be in control of how and when objects in the collection are processed when using a loop or an iterator. This is not the case with streams and aggregate operationsâ€”all of the iteration and control of how and when objects are acted upon are internal to the operation.
* The parameters for aggregate operations are lambda expressions.
