# Ensuring Quality

Testing is arguably one of **the most important** concepts that we will cover in this course. This is just the introduction. We will continue to learn about testing for the remainder of the course. A solid understanding of testing will be vital to your success in the course.

#### What is Software Testing?

Technically speaking **Testing** is the process of ensuring that an application meets the specifications, requirements, and is free of bugs. 

#### Why is testing so important?

Testing allows for us as developers to not only test to make sure our code is running as expected but it is also a valuable planning tool. Writing tests first forces us to think harder about our design and therefore helps us create higher quality code with more cohesion.

#### What does this mean practically?

Up until now the tests have been provided for you \(Again tests existed and so we knew exactly what we needed to do in our code\) however, moving forward, this means that we will need to write the additional code that runs parts of our application and tests that they do what we expect. 

### Types of Tests

There are several different types of tests. In this course weâ€™ll focus primarily on 4 types: 

* **Unit Tests** - testing individual units of code \(usually a method\) 
* **Integration Tests** - testing the interaction between 2 or more units of code
* **System Tests** - testing that the entire system meets requirements
* **Acceptance Tests** - testing that the software meets business and user needs
