# JUnit Docs - Activity

Checkout the documentation for JUnit [here!](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/)

Note that JUnit 5 is out now, but we are using 4.12. Thatâ€™s because 4.12 ships with the Spring Initializr starter dependencies. You are welcome \(and encouraged\) to independently upgrade your projects to 5 if you like!

Goals:

* Read through the documentation for 10 minutes. Be curious. Google. Learn.
* After 10 minutes, implement one new annotation that you learned \(Note that the heading for assertions in the documentation says `Annotation Type <Name>`
* Implement one additional feature you learned about.
