# Go Kart Testing

### Go Kart Unit Testing

Suppose you manufacture small go-karts for children. You begin by manufacturing an axle. Axles need to support any weight up to 200lbs. You then test if the axle can support that weight. This is a **UNIT TEST.**

Next you build the wheels. The wheels need to also hold weight up to 200lbs and maintain integrity for 200 miles of travel on rough gravel. You test the wheels ability to meet these requirements. This is also a **UNIT TEST.** 

### **Go Kart Integration Testing**

Then you put the wheels on the axle. They need to fit perfectly with zero slip and stay connected during turns with an angular frequency of 1.8 radians/second\*. ****You test that these requirements are met when the two units are put together. 

This is an **INTEGRATION TEST.**

You continue to unit test each piece \(seat, steering wheel, motor, chassis, etc \) as you build them and then test their integration with every component that they directly interface with. 

### **Go Kart System Testing**

Finally, you have a complete Go-Kart! You put a crash dummy on board and take that sucker out for a spin. Ensuring it runs, turns, steers, and brakes as expected. 

 Congrats! You just completed your **SYSTEM TEST.**

### Go Kart Acceptance Test

Now you get a bunch of kids together and make sure they love it! 

Can they reach the pedals? Do they understand how to steer, accelerate, and brake? Do they like the color? Is the seat comfortable? Woohoo! **ACCEPTANCE TEST** complete.
