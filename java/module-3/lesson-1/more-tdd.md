# More TDD

### A Quick Note

Tests serve as a debugging tool, a means to ensure that your code meets the clients requirements, documentation, and design tool. 

It is entirely normal to spend more time writing tests than coding and have more lines of test code than production code. 

The money spent on developer time writing tests, pays for itself ten fold in saved developer time on maintenance and debugging.

### Getting Better at Testing

We stated the importance of Testing and TDD earlier, but we canâ€™t overstate it enough. We will spend the remainder of the course practicing TDD on virtually every project.

Independent Learning is vital to your success as developers. If you want to make the most of this opportunity, you must read deeply about the concepts we cover in this course, tackle side projects in every spare moment no matter how small, and combine this research and these practical skills to tackle increasingly difficult tasks.

### TDD: Again

It may seem like we just talked about Test Driven Development, but that's how important it is. Testing is vital to your success as developers.

**Remember** that in this course we are using the **Red Green Refactor** **Method** of testing.

* Begin by writing **failing** tests.
* Then write the **minimum** code necessary to pass the tests.
* Then refactor the code and tests as needed, but **not** simultaneously.

Also as you go through writing your tests remember to think about **equivalency classes** and how you can test for multiple inputs.
