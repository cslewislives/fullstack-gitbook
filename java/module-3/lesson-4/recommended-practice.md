## Activities

The activity included in this section will enhance you knowledge of exception handling.  

You **should** write your code to **pass the tests** that are included with the starter file. The tests will be triggered when the IntelliJ program is run. The output screen will detail any discrepancies.  

As always, we do encourage you to search Google for information on challenging concepts.

Solutions for these activities can be found in the Java Activities-Solution Files section of this Gitbook.
