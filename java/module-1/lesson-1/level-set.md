# Level Set

Below you will find a link to a slide show that will assist in understanding some of the systems and terminology that you will encounter as we move through this first lesson and on to creating your first Java project. 

As with most of the material you will find throughout this pre-work, Google is an excellent source of supplemental knowledge.  We encourage you to search out additional information from alternate sources on challenging concepts.
