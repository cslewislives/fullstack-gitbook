# Recommended Practice

{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/m1l1katas \(2\).zip" caption="Module1\_Lesson1\_Katas" %}

Each of the Lesson will have a section of 'Recommended Practice'. It will consist of exercises, called Katas, that will help to solidify the concepts covered over the course of the lesson.

Completing the Recommended Practice katas associated with each lesson will greatly increase your chances of successfully navigating the required 'Summative Assessment' evaluation which is found at the end of each module.  

## Activities

* A Chatty Program
* A Postcard From Me
* Marvel Table
* Formatted Output - Challenge Problem

There is starter code for all 4 of the katas included in the file. 

You **should** write your code to **pass the tests** that are included with the starter file. The tests will be triggered when the IntelliJ program is run. The output screen will detail any discrepancies.  

For your information, Challenge Problems are always good to attempt. They are designed to stretch your knowledge and prepare you for future concepts. 

Finally, we always encourage you to search Google for additional information on challenging concepts.

Solutions for these activities can be found in the Java Activities-Solution Files section of this Gitbook.
