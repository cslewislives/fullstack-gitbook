# HelloWorld! - Activity

## Creating an IntelliJ Project

The best way to learn to code is to jump in with both feet. 

For this `helloworld` activity, we are going to start by creating a new project.

We suggest reading the following steps, watching the related video, and only then creating the project on your own.  

* Open your IntelliJ IDE. 
* From the introductory screen, click `+ Create New Project`.
* Select Maven in the New Project pane \(leave the “Create from archetype” box unchecked\). Also take note of the Project SDK. This should always be set to "1.8 \(java version "1.8.0\_...\)".
* Click Next.
* Type `com.company` in the GroupId textbox.
* Type `HelloWorld` in the ArtifactId textbox.
* Leave Version Id unchanged.
* Click Next.
* Leave Project Name as HelloWorld.
* Notice the "Project location" text box. This will tell you the location on your computer where the project you are creating will be saved. Take note of this file path. The default project location is fine for this project, but you can change it if you want to. 
* Click Finish.

Below you will find the related video for the beginning of this HelloWorld! activity.
