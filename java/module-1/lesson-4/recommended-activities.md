## Activities

There are two filed associated with the Lesson 4 activities.  

1. Lesson 4 Debugger - This activity examines your ability to work with the Intelli-J IDE debugger to solve problems in the code. 
2. Lesson 4 Katas - These activities are more consistent with the usual katas. 

* SubtractTwo
* SubtractOrZero
*  Max
* Min
* isLarger

There is starter code for both of the Lesson 4 katas included in the file. 

You **should** write your code to **pass the tests** that are included with the starter file. The tests will be triggered when the IntelliJ program is run. The output screen will detail any discrepancies.  

As always,  we do encourage you to search Google for information on challenging concepts.

Solutions for these activities can be found in the Java Activities-Solution Files section of this Gitbook.
