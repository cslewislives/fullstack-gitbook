# Recommended Practice

{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/m1l2katas \(1\).zip" caption="Module1\_Lesson2\_Katas" %}

## Activities

* Average Three
* MultiplyThree
* AddFive
* SubtractTwo
* AddThirteen
* AddFiveAndDouble
* DoubleAndAddFive 

There is starter code for all 7 of the katas included in the file. 

You **should** write your code to **pass the tests** that are included with the starter file. The tests will be triggered when the IntelliJ program is run. The output screen will detail any discrepancies.  

As always, we do encourage you to search Google for information on challenging concepts.

Solutions for these activities can be found in the Java Activities-Solution Files section of this Gitbook.
