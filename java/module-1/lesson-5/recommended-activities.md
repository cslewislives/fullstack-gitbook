There is starter code for all 11 of the katas included in the file. 

You **should** write your code to **pass the tests** that are included with the starter file. The tests will be triggered when the IntelliJ program is run. The output screen will detail any discrepancies.  

As mentioned earlier in the Module, Challenge Problems are always good to attempt. They are designed to stretch your knowledge and prepare you for future concepts. 

As always, we do encourage you to search Google for information on challenging concepts.

Solutions for these activities can be found in the Java Activities-Solution Files section of this Gitbook.
